This project implements binary trees in C.

## Description
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right).

## Structures
- `binary_tree_t` - Basic binary tree
- `bst_t` - Binary Search Tree
- `avl_t` - AVL Tree (self-balancing BST)
- `heap_t` - Binary Heap

## Files
- `binary_trees.h` - Header file
- `0-binary_tree_node.c` - Creates a binary tree node
- `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c` - Inserts a node as left child
- `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c` - Inserts a node as right child
- And more...
